I'm a member of the [Signal Processing Algorithm Design and Analysis (SPADA) lab](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/?page_id=235) advised by Professor Laura Balzano at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on nonconvex optimization problems with applications in computer vision and signal processing applications. My favorite problems include
<ul>
  <li>Nonconvex matrix and tensor factorization</li>
  <li>Optimization on Riemannian manifolds</li>
  <li>Online methods and low-dimensional models</li>
  <li>Randomized matrix sketching</li>
</ul>
