I am a currently a Member of Technical Staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory researching machine learning for RF signal processing. I received my PhD from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan in 2022, where I was advised by Professor Laura Balzano. 

My research focuses on unsupervised machine learning, statistical signal processing, and optimization. I design and analyze new algorithms for problems with big messy data, developing methods with principled modeling techniques and theoretical guarantees. I have applied my work across a diverse range of real applications that spans signal processing, computer vision, medical imaging, banking, environmental sensing, and more. My favorite problems include
<ul>
  <li>Low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations</li>
  <li>Optimization</li>
  <li>Online/streaming algorithms</li>
  <li>Heteroscedastic noise models</li>
  <li>Data with noisy, missing, and/or corrupted entries</li>
  <li>Semidefinite programming</li>
</ul>
